# Week 3: Analytical Thinking & Advanced SQL

This week focused on moving from data manipulation to real analytics:
- Formulating and testing business hypotheses
- Writing complex SQL with subqueries and CTEs
- Building pivot tables and heatmaps for trend analysis

## Key files
- `day16_sql_practice.sql` — advanced SQL queries (CTE, subqueries)
- `day17_hypothesis_testing.py` — hypothesis formulation and validation
- `day19_pivot_heatmap.py` — genre vs decade analysis with IMDB data

All results are reproducible and documented.
