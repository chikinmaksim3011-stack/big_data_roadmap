# Week 2: Data Visualization

This week I practiced data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** on real-world datasets.

## Datasets used:
- **Iris** — classic dataset for classification (sepal/petal measurements)
- **Netflix Titles** — movies and TV shows with type, country, etc.
- **IMDB Top 1000** — movie ratings, genres, release years

## Skills practiced:
- Building histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exporting visualizations to PNG files
- Writing code with English comments
- Version control with Git in PyCharm

All scripts are fully executable and include descriptive visualizations.
