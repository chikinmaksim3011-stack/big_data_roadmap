# Week 4: BI, A/B Testing & Time Series

This week focused on real-world analytics tools and concepts:
- Building dashboards in Redash (cloud-based BI)
- Designing and interpreting A/B tests
- Understanding algorithmic complexity of queries
- Analyzing time series with Python
- Advanced SQL with window functions

## Key files
- `day22_redash_dashboard.png` — screenshot of my first BI dashboard
- `day23_ab_test.txt` — A/B test interpretation and hypothesis design
- `day24_query_complexity.txt` — analysis of query performance
- `day25_time_series.py` — time series analysis with moving average
- `day26_window_functions.sql` — advanced user behavior analysis with window functions
- `day27_week4_vocab.md` — key English terms for analytics

All code is reproducible and documented.
