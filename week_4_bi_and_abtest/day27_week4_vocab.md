- **A/B-test**
  
    is the test, where we check out our hypothesis with A-group - neutral group - checking an old version, and B-group - testing group - testing a new version.
- **Conversion rate**

    is a percent of people, who did our exercise. *Conversion rate = integer exercise / integer people in group*
- **p-value**  
  The probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.  
  *A p-value below 0.05 indicates statistical significance.*
- **Null hypothesis**
    
    If our conversion rate is equal in A/B test, we are trying to refute this.
- **Relative conversion rate**

    using for big results in the paper:)
   
   *Relative conversion rate = (conversion rate B - conversion rate A) / conversion rate A * 100%*
- **Dashboard**  
  A visual interface that displays key metrics and KPIs in real time.  
  *We built a Redash dashboard to monitor daily active users.*
- **O(1) - constant time**

    Processing of our query doesn't depend volume data.
- **O(n) - line time**

    Time is growing if volume of data is growing too.
- **O(log n) - logarithmic time**

    For the next step half of the data is discarded. It's using to binary search for example.
- **O(n^2) - square time**

    For the next n element we're go over it again.
