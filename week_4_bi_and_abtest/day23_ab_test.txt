Group A: 10,000 users, 850 purchases
Group B: 10,000 users, 920 purchases
→ Calculate the conversion rate (%) for each group.
→ What is the absolute lift in percentage points?
→ What is the relative lift (as a % increase vs. Group A)?

1. А-group - 8,5%
   B-group - 9,2%
   Absolute lift in percentage points is 0,7 p.p.
   Relative lift is (9,2-8,5) / 8,5 = 0,082 = 8,2%

You receive test results:
Group A conversion: 8.5%
Group B conversion: 9.2%
p-value = 0.03
→ Should the company launch the new version? Why or why not?
→ How would you summarize this in a report to a product manager?

2. The company should launch the new version, because p-value show us that results were not get casually.
We say to a product manager that our A/B test was get positive results and our innovation increased by 8,2% than old version.

Propose a realistic A/B test for a food delivery app:
What is being tested? (e.g., button text, page layout, notification timing)
What metric are you trying to improve? (e.g., conversion, average order value, retention)
State the null hypothesis (H₀) and alternative hypothesis (H₁).

3. So, we're want to the place discounts under the buttons of restaurants and products.
   We're want to increase retention and retention rate.
   The null hypothesis is a feature that our decision will not affect customer behavior.
   The alternative hypothesis is a feature that our users will be return for more orders.
